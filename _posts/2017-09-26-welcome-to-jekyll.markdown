Hey folks,

Sometimes there are so many tools that it is really hard to pick up a favorite. After messing around I decided to no use the most powerful or with more bell and whistles. A friend mentioned Jekyll as simple alternative. Less distractions, simpler formatting. I hope I can keep my focus in what is important and spit up content left and right.

See ya!
